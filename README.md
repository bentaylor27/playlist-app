# This application allows users to create collaborative playlists with their friends without having to buy a streaming service. Users can add music to the database, create and delete playlists, add collaborators, and view the songs in each playlist. This was built using Python and SQLite for the back-end. This application has a user authentication feature so that users can log-in and save their playlists.
